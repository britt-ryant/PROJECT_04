# PROJECT_04 Connection



# MVP:

An mvp for this project will be a basic tinder-like app that allows you to create a profile, add photos of yourself to the profile, edit the information of your profile and delete your profile.  The app will allow you to view everyone else's profiles from a browse view and match with people that you like.  The linking feature and profile accessibility will be require for the MVP. There will be additional features that I would like to add to this but will not be completely necessary to achieve MVP, such as, oauth, push notifications, and proximity services(these would be considered my reach goals).


# User Stories

A user will be able to sign up to my app, creating their own account.  The account will editable and the user can create their account based on preferences.  Once the user has created their own account, they can browse other profiles and match based on their preference.  If two users match, they will have the ability to message each other.
